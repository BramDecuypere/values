## Next steps

- Find 3 people that are irritating you - What is the opposite value they are showing you?


Values come after life happening
As I'm more me, I'm more aware of what I like and dislike, what I admire
Only from that I know what my values are.

Because they make me feel in allignment with myself

Not making decisions according to my values, is not being me (integrity)
I lose faith in myself
I feel lost - hopeless

There is no meaning to life

Values help you control the stream of life

Avoid depression (you don't know who you are - a reason to be alive)
What is my contribution? 
You don't know why

What is the action You will be taking?
What the hell am I doing? 

If you don't follow a small breadcrumb of your own

Following your intuition

Values can completely change your life - imagine a life where you would be completely dedicated to.
